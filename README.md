<a href="https://ibb.co/RSqWdwk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/rtVJNrR/Image-Identification-App.png" alt="Image-Identification-App" border="0"></a>




An image identification application **built in React and deployed on Firebase** using machine learning framework for browser **"TensorFlow.js" and pre-trained model for image classification "MobileNet".**

- **Upload a single Image and identify the object in Image.**
- **You can use "Image URL" from the internet.**
- **Recent images option to see what images you have tried so far.....**


## Tech and Resources üëá

The app is built using following mentioned tech and resources:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)** - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)** - Machine Learning framework for browser from Google.
- **[MobileNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNet)** - A pre-trained model built on CNN architecture for the image classification task. It is trained on ImageNet dataset. De facto dataset for popular Computer Vision and Deep Learning architectures.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** - Firebase helps you build and run successful apps. The app is deployed on Firebase. See the Deployment part to know more.

## Installation üëá

**If you want to create a fresh and new react app. Please use below command in your blank project directory:**

```sh
npx create-react-app .
```
The above command will help you installing create-react-app if you already don't have and then you can use this repo and modify it.

If you want to run the same application, It requires npm to install and run the app.

**Install the dependencies and start the server:**

```sh
cd image_identification_app
npm install 
npm start
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm run build
```
It will create a build folder that you can use to deploy the app in production. 


## Deployment üëá

The app is deployed on Firebase.
